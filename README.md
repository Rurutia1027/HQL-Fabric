# Spring Batch Data Flow 

A practical playground for mastering **Spring Batch** by building real-world batch job pipelines integrated with a variety of **message brokers**, **data format**, and **data stores**. This repo explores different **combinations of message systems**. 

--- 

## üåü What is tihs about ? 
In modern microservice architectures, manaing distributed data flow -- especially when involving **high-throughput message queues** (like Kafka, RabbitMQ, or ActiveMQ) and **diverse data destinations** (e.g., databases, CSV files, Redis) -- can become unmanageable with hand-written listeners or thread pool tricks. 

This project aims to **replace  ad-hoc dta processing pipelines** with a structured, scalable, and production-friendly approach powered by **Spring Batch**. 

--- 

## Goals 
- Explore **Kafka**, **RabbitMQ**, **ActiveMQ**, **Redis**, and more as **data sources**.
- Read/write/transform data from **CSV**, **JSON**, **relational databases**, and **NoSQL**
- Use **partitioned Kafka topics** and store those partitions in separate data sinks
- Learn chunk-oriented and tasklet-based Spring Batch processing
- Combine different messaging systems in one cohesive job
- Apply Spring Batch best practices for monitoring, scaling, and maintainability

## How to Run 
// todo 

--- 

## üîÆ Future Topics 
- Spring Batch + GraphQL feed processing
- Remote chunking across microservices
- Parallel JOb execution on Kubernetes (multi-pod partitions)
- Batch failure reporting via Slack/Email alerts
- Integration with Spring Cloud Task / Data Flow
