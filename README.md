# spring-middleware-kit

## Overview
`spring-middleware-kit` is a **Spring-based middleware integration toolkit** that helps developers quickly configure and integrate commonly used middleware components. It aims to improve development efficiency by providing **pre-configured solutions** for Spring applications, reducing the time spent on setup and configuration.

## Why This Repository?
In real-world projects, integrating different middleware with Spring often requires:
- Understanding different configuration styles and properties.
- Handling version compatibility issues.
- Implementing best practices for security and performance.

This repository simplifies the process by offering **ready-to-use integrations** that follow best practices, allowing developers to focus more on business logic.

## Supported Middleware
This repository covers integration examples and best practices for:
- **Service Discovery & Configuration**: Nacos, Consul, Eureka
- **API Gateway**: Spring Cloud Gateway
- **Messaging & Event Streaming**: Kafka, RabbitMQ
- **Caching**: Redis
- **Relational Databases**: MySQL, PostgreSQL

## How to Use?
Each middleware component will have its own subproject with standalone configurations. You can explore different integrations and adapt them to your needs.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to add new integrations or improve existing ones.
